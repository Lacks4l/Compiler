HELLO!  

The premise of the awful program is to compile my hastiliy created PACL code.  

PACL is a language I had the idea for with a friend and then took it upon myself to create.  The basis of the language are a C/C++/Java-esque syntax but with a variety of features I find useful as well as a suite of libraries aimed at GUI development.
